# Update $path in Mac

!!! info ""
    Let's imagine we have to update the Python path in PATH variable

- Paths are available in `/etc/paths`. Update then using

```sh
sudo bash
vim /etc/paths
```

- Enter the path of the Python install directory at the end of this list.

- Reload `bashrc` using `source ~/.bashrc`
