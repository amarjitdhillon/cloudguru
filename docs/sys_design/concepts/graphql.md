## What is GraphQL?
GraphQL is a popular `data query language` developed by Facebook. 

!!! important "Issues with REST"

    It was designed as an alternative to REST (Representational State Transfer) because of REST’s perceived weaknesses such as:

        1. Multiple round-trips 
        2. Over-fetching
        3. Problems with versioning
    
    GraphQL attempts to solve these problems by providing a hierarchical, declarative way of performing queries from a single end point.

## why GraphQL is powerful?

GraphQL gives power to the client. Instead of specifying the structure of the
response on the server, it’s defined on the client. The client
can specify what properties and relationships to return. 

GraphQL aggregates data from multiple sources and returns it to the client in a single round trip, which makes it an efficient system for retrieving data.
