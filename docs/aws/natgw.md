## What is NAT Gateway


- A NAT gateway is a Network Address Translation (NAT) service. 
- You can use a NAT gateway so that instances in a private subnet can connect to services outside your VPC but external services cannot initiate a connection with those instances.


NAT Gateway is a highly available AWS managed service that makes it easy to connect to the Internet from instances within a private subnet in an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC). Previously, you needed to launch a NAT instance to enable NAT for instances in a private subnet. 



!!! remember
    A NAT gateway is preferable to a NAT instance because it is managed by AWS rather than you, the architect.
