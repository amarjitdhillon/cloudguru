- There are slight differences between a normal 'new' Security Group and a 'default' security group in the default VPC. For a 'new' security group nothing is allowed in by default.

- Security groups evaluate all the rules on the group before deciding how to handle the traffic.
- Security groups only provide for allow rules.
- Security groups operate at the instance level.
